# How to build the examples

1. Either copy or link one of these folders to `src/App` (notice the capitalization on **A**pp, as only this exact path is included).
- Example (from the src folder): `ln -s ../examples/UIFrameworkTest App`
- Example 2 (from the src folder): `cp -t App -r ../examples/UIFrameworkTest`
2. Build the project following the instructions in the main README file.
